# Quick Start: K-Means Clustering for Stakeholder Subgroups

## 3-Minute Guide

### What You'll Do
Automatically group stakeholders into meaningful clusters using machine learning.

### Prerequisites
- Complete SAT Step 1 (rate all stakeholders on Power, Interest, Legitimacy, Urgency)

### Steps

#### 1. Navigate (30 seconds)
```
SAT → Step 2: Management Tool → Subgroup Management → 🤖 Automatic Clustering
```

#### 2. Configure (1 minute)
- **Number of Clusters**: Use slider to select (recommend 3-4)
- **Features**: Keep all 4 selected (Power, Interest, Legitimacy, Urgency)
- Click **🤖 Generate Clusters**

#### 3. Review (1.5 minutes)
- Check **3D Visualization** - are clusters well-separated?
- Review **Cluster Statistics** - do averages make sense?
- Examine **2D Projections** - verify groupings

### What You Get

**Automatic subgroups like:**
- Key Players (Cluster 1) - 5 stakeholders
- Keep Satisfied (Cluster 2) - 4 stakeholders
- Keep Informed (Cluster 3) - 6 stakeholders
- Monitor (Cluster 4) - 3 stakeholders

Each with:
- ✅ Members automatically assigned
- ✅ Average metrics calculated
- ✅ Strategic recommendations
- ✅ Visual profiles

### Quick Tips

**Recommended Settings for Common Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Clusters | Features |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Simple prioritization | 3 | Power + Interest |
| Classic matrix | 4 | All four |
| Detailed segmentation | 5-6 | All four |
| Training levels | 3 | Interest + Legitimacy |

### What's Next?

1. Go to **Subgroup Analysis** section
2. Select a cluster to analyze
3. View aggregated metrics and radar chart
4. Read strategic recommendations
5. Develop targeted engagement plans

### Common Patterns

**Good Results:**
- Clear separation in 3D plot
- Balanced cluster sizes (not too uneven)
- Distinct average characteristics

**Needs Adjustment:**
- Overlapping clusters → Try different number
- Unbalanced sizes → Check data quality
- Similar averages → May need manual grouping

### Compare: Manual vs Automatic

| Manual | Automatic (K-Means) |
|--------|-------------------|
| 10-30 minutes | 1 minute |
| Subjective | Data-driven |
| Based on intuition | Based on similarity |
| One dimension focus | Multi-dimensional |

### Best Practice Workflow

```
1. Auto-generate clusters (K-means) ← Start here
2. Review assignments
3. Make manual adjustments (if needed)
4. Add special custom groups (optional)
5. Analyze subgroups
6. Develop strategies
```

### Example Output

**Cluster 1: Key Players** (5 members)
- Avg Power: 8.2
- Avg Interest: 7.8
- Strategy: Manage Closely
- Members: Government Official, Lead Retailer, Export Partner, Training Director, Master Artisan

**Cluster 2: Keep Informed** (7 members)
- Avg Power: 4.1
- Avg Interest: 8.3
- Strategy: Regular Updates
- Members: Local Artisans, Young Trainees, Community Leaders, etc.

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Clustering button not working
**Fix**: Ensure you have at least 2 rated stakeholders

**Issue**: Results seem random
**Fix**: Check if your ratings are too uniform

**Issue**: Want to change assignments
**Fix**: Go to Manual Grouping tab and reassign

### Next Level

After basic clustering, try:
- Different cluster numbers (experiment)
- Different feature combinations
- Temporal analysis (cluster at different times)
- Hybrid approach (auto + manual)

**Time Investment**: 3 minutes
**Value**: Objective, data-driven stakeholder grouping
**Result**: Actionable subgroups ready for strategy development
