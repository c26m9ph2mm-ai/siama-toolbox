# Nature of Craft - 5P Framework Guide

## Overview
The Nature of Craft module helps you define and analyze your craft's characteristics across five key dimensions using the **5P Framework**: Product, Proficiency, Process, Purpose, and Portrayal.

## What is the 5P Framework?

The 5P Framework provides a comprehensive way to understand the nature of a craft by examining it across five concentric layers, from its deepest meaning to its market manifestation.

### The Five Dimensions

1. **Product** (Outer layer) - The tangible craft output
2. **Proficiency** - The skills and knowledge required
3. **Process** - The methods and techniques used
4. **Purpose** - The functional and social objectives
5. **Portrayal** (Core) - The cultural and symbolic meaning

## How to Use

### Step 1: View the Schematic Diagram
The circular diagram shows the five layers of craft definition, with Portrayal at the core and Product at the outer layer.

### Step 2: Assess Current Status
Navigate to the **📍 Current Status** tab and select all characteristics that describe your craft's **current state**:

- Expand each of the 5P dimensions
- Review Secondary Nature options
- Review Tertiary Nature options
- Check boxes for applicable characteristics
- Click "💾 Save Current Status"

### Step 3: Define Desired Status
Navigate to the **🎯 Desired New Status** tab and select characteristics you want your craft to **achieve or develop**:

- Expand each of the 5P dimensions
- Select characteristics you aspire to have
- This may include some current characteristics (to maintain) and new ones (to develop)
- Click "💾 Save Desired Status"

### Step 4: Analyze the Gap
The system automatically generates:

#### Gap Analysis Table
- Shows Current, Desired, and Gap for each dimension
- Positive gap = need development
- Zero/negative gap = achieved or over-delivered

#### Visualizations
- **Current vs Desired Chart**: Side-by-side comparison
- **Gap Analysis Chart**: Visual representation of development needs

#### Development Recommendations
- Specific guidance for dimensions needing development
- Recognition for dimensions where goals are achieved

#### Detailed Comparison Table
- Characteristic-by-characteristic analysis
- Action indicators:
  - ✅ Maintained - Keep this characteristic
  - ⬆️ To develop - Work on acquiring this
  - ⬇️ To reduce - Consider deprioritizing
